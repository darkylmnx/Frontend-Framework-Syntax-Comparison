## What is the goal of this project ?

Are you lost when it comes to choosing a frontend framework or view library ?
You're on the right project spot then.
The Hikaku project helps you to objectively compare frontend frameworks / view libraries based on their syntax and usage.
You will also have some ready-to-use code snippets for basic tasks.

This project is inspired by https://vanilla-js.com and http://youmightnotneedjquery.com which compares **vanilla JS** to **jQuery**.

We are going to compare Vue and React for the moment but, you are welcome to contribute and add other component-based frameworks / libraries.
