# Hikaku - Frontend Component Frameworks Syntax and Usage Comparison

## What is the goal of this project ?

Are you tired of frontend frameworks war ? Because we are !
The goal of this project is to compare without any opinion syntax and usage between major frontend frameworks.

This project is inspired by https://vanilla-js.com which compares **vanilla JS** to **jQuery**.

## What framewoks will you compare ?

We are going to compare Vue and React for the moment but you are welcome to contribute for other component-based frameworks / libraries.

## How can you compare ?

We are going to launch a static page written in markdown where we show exactly the same code writtent in React and Vue.

That's it for now.
